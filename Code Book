Read the Read.ME file to understand the data set

Creating the "Train" dataset:
  Extracted the "X_train", "y_train", "Features", under the folder called data
  Loaded  the X_train data and updated the column names with the second column of the Feature file 
  Added a column to the X_Train data that included the Subject ID to the Train data set.
  Updated and saved the X_Train as "trainup" that now has updated coulmn headers and additional subject ID column.

Creating the "Test" dataset:
  Extracrted the "X_test", "y_test", under the folder called data
  Loaded  the Y_test data and updated the column names with the second column of the Feature file
  Added a column to the X_test data that included the Subject ID to the y_test data set.
  Updated and saved the X_Test as "testup" that now has updated coulmn headers and additional subject ID column.

Combining the train and test datasets
  Combined both " testup" and "trainup" by keeping the columns the same and adding rows to the data table.
  The table increase in rows ( but the columns remained the same)
  "data.all "  data set of  10299 rows, 563 column is created.

New Data Set with selected Mean and Standard deviation values
  From the "data.all" dataset, columns of subject, activity are selected alongwith all the cloumns that have mean and std in the column names
  these columns are saved in a new data set called  "updated.data" 
  The number of rows remian the same i.e. 10299 rows but number of columns have reduced to 88 as only columns full filling the criteria are saved.
  
Changing the numeric acitivity lables to readbale english labels
  Extract the activity lables for the data zip file and save it to data folder
  load the label file to R as "actlabels"
  update the values of the activity column of updated.data  with second column of actlabels.
  the numerics are replaced by the corresponding factor/ names in the lables
  
 Improving the labels of the data set with descriptive variable names to improve readability
  Extract all the column lables into a separate vector named "descriptive_names"
  Substite the following to make the labels readable
      Removed ()
      susbstituted " preceeding t" to TimeDomain
      susbstituted "preceeding f", "FrequencyDomain
      susbstituted "Acc" to  "Accelerometer"
      susbstituted"Gyro"to "Gyroscope"
      susbstituted "Mag" to "Magnitude"
      susbstituted"-mean-" to "_Mean_"
      susbstituted ("-std-"to "_StandardDeviation_"
      susbstituted"_std" to "_StandardDeviation_"
      susbstituted "BodyBody" to  "Body"
      susbstituted "-" to "_"
 
  Updated the columnnames of "update.data" with the new vector that is easier to read.

Group and Mean variables for subjects and activity
    Dplyr package was loaded
    Data was grouped by subject and activity so that each each activity is assigned to a its unique subject
    mean of all the column variables was calcualted
    the new data set was saved in a data table called "final_data"
